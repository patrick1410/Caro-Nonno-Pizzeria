16 ounces pizza dough, store-bought or homemade (I like this no-knead version, though note that this recipe makes enough dough for 2 pizzas)
1/2 cup pizza sauce (see below)
6 ounces goudse cheese, grated
12 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 teaspoon fresh oregano, optional
Flour for rolling and shaping dough
red pepper
